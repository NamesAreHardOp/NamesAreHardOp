# Feedback Accumulation
* Add port forwarding to containers
* Highlighted menu items should have a brighter colour than non-highlighted (white is the brightest colour of all)
* Do you think a developer audience would use a project that isn't open source to run all their essential devops tools?
* We don't want to use all lowercase for our name ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
